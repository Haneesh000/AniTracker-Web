# AniTracker
AniTracker is a simple web application that allows users to keep track of the anime they are currently watching. Users can add, edit, and delete anime from their list. AniTracker also provides a search feature that allows users to search for anime by title. AniTracker is built using the React framework and the Jikan API.
